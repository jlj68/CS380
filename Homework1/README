The only working part of this project is the random walk and even that
causes seg faults. I am very busy with graduation stuff so I did not have
time to debug everything. The DFS and BFS implementation is in main.cpp but
I do not have it executed as I know it does not work. However, I do think
that the implementation is close, there are just some bugs I don't have time
to find.

To build/run the project, just use "$ make build" and "$ make run"
respectively. For now, runnning just loads in SBP-level0.txt and does a
single random walk.
