To build/run the project, just use "$ make build" and "$ make run1", "$ make
run2", or "$ make run3" in order to run parts 1/2/3 of in the main function.
You can also just build the project once then use "$ ./hw2 N", where 'N' is
the part you would like to run.

Also, please note that this project takes a *VERY* long time to execute - I
will need to do some sort of optimization in the future to speed it up.

PROOF OF HEURISTIC ADMISSABILITY:

The heuristic I used adds the Manhattan distance with the number of bricks
in the way of the goal brick to the destination.

This is clearly admissible because the goal brick will need to move at least
as many times as the value of the Manhattan distance (i.e. if M.D. = 5 then
the goal brick will need to move at least 5 times) and all of the bricks in
the way of the goal brick will also need to move in order for the goal brick
to reach to destination.
